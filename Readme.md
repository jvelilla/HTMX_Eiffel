## Task
- Display a count that represents how many times the page has been requested.

- Add an endpoint POST /count to that increments the count value and returns the index.html page.
- Remove the incrementing in the Get / route
- add a button to the HTML 

- index.html now require an object with `contacts`
- we need a new endpoint `/contacts` that takes `POST` request
